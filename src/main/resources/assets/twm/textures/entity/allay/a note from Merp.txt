Hi! I'm Merp. I'm the texture artist, animator, and sound designer for TWM.

Congrats! You found the easter egg!

This was not really supposed to be here, to be truthfully honest with you. 
It ended up here because I forgot to remove it, and I later decided it would be neat to keep in as an easter egg.

So, if you came here only looking for the Allay, I'm fine if you use my Allay texture and all, as long as you credit me for it.
PLEASE credit me for it. It is my texture.

Thanks for checking the mod out!
